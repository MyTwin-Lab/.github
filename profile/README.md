# Welcome to MyTwin Lab
Here, everyone can take part: patients, doctors, developers, researchers, students, biohackersâ€¦ everyone has a role to play ðŸ§¬âœ¨

### The Labâ€™s first challenge:
Building an AI capable of analyzing medical images.
- It will be free for citizens, patients, and independent doctors, so they can analyze their own medical images.
- It will be paid for healthcare institutions (clinics, hospitals), which will allow us to directly reward the contributorsâ€¦ that means you! ðŸ’¡

### Each AI will be developed as part of a 3-month challenge:
1. Build the team
2. Develop the open-source AI within 3 months
3. Make it accessibleÂ worldwide
